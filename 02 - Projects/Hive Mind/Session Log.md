# Hive Mind — Session Log (Append-Only)

> Every Claude Code session — in any workspace — writes a 1–5 line entry here on close via the `hive-mind-sync` skill. Entries are reverse-chronological. This file is the single thread that connects all project workspaces into one continuous conversation for future agents.

## How to write an entry

Keep entries tight. Format:

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — Workspace name — one-line headline
- What was done (1–3 lines, outcomes not process)
- Cross-project impact, if any (mentions of other workspaces)
- Canonical facts promoted to Unity: [[wiki-links to updated notes]]
```

## What belongs here (vs. project-local memory)

**Write here** when the work touches more than one workspace, produces a canonical fact (client/server/credential), or would be useful to an agent in a DIFFERENT project next week.

**Keep in project-local memory** when the work is only about that codebase's internals — a fix to a specific file, a local test failure, a refactor inside one module. Those stay in `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`.

## Log (newest first)

### 2026-04-22 (late evening) — D:/Development — All 5 research recommendations + 3 risk mitigations implemented
- **#1 Graphify git hooks** — `graphify hook install` ran in all 6 git repos (Unity, Development, ECOSIRE.COM, ECOSIRE.AI, ECOSIRE.IO, OpenClaw). post-commit + post-checkout hooks now auto-refresh AST on every commit (no LLM, <1s).
- **#2 Graphify MCP server** — `.mcp.json` files at Unity root + D:/Development root register `unity-hive-mind` MCP server pointing at `Unity/graphify-out/graph.json`. `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true` set in `~/.claude/settings.json`. `pip install --user mcp` already done. Any agent in these sessions gets `query_graph/get_node/get_neighbors/shortest_path` as tools without custom skill code.
- **#3 AGENTS.md shims** — written at every workspace root (Development, ECOSIRE.COM, ECOSIRE.AI, ECOSIRE.IO, Company, Office, Unity). Future-proofs against Codex/Aider/Gemini-CLI sessions.
- **#4 claude-mem installed** — `npx claude-mem install` registered the plugin at user level (`~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack/`). Bun 1.3.13 + uv 0.11.7 also installed (prerequisites). Worker daemon failed to start on first try (Windows-specific health-check timeout); plugin hooks will activate in the next Claude Code session — worker troubleshooting deferred.
- **#5 defuddle-ingest skill** — user-level skill at `~/.claude/skills/defuddle-ingest/`. Opinionated wrapper around `defuddle parse` for platform-api-intelligence + general research note ingests. Auto-installs `npm install -g defuddle` on first use.
- **Risk #1 — Credential guard** — PreToolUse hook at `~/.claude/hooks/guard_credentials.sh`. Any `Read` on `Unity/03 - Areas/Credentials & Access/**` returns exit 2 with a warning injected into the model's context. Registered in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `hooks.PreToolUse`.
- **Risk #2 — Staleness check** — `scripts/hive-mind/check_graph_freshness.sh` scans all 5 target graphs, flags any where source files are >7d newer than `graph.json`. Tested: Unity fresh, 4 others missing (expected, needs first `/graphify .`). Integrated into `unity-audit` section 3.
- **Rename:** `hive-mind-audit` skill renamed to `unity-audit` (more memorable, anchors on the product name). Expanded from 10 checks to 14 checks covering all new infra from this session: graphify git hooks, MCP server + `.mcp.json`, AGENTS.md shims, claude-mem plugin + worker, Bun/uv runtime, credentials guard hook.
- **Risk #3 — Dropbox+multi-agent write races** — `hive-mind-sync` already commits + pushes Unity on session end; existing daily scheduled backup is the catch-up. Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.claude/` (upstream skills) and `graphify-out/` (regeneratable) from git tracking, preventing accidental submodule/conflict scenarios.
- Pending next session: run `/graphify .` inside D:/Development / ECOSIRE.COM / ECOSIRE.AI / ECOSIRE.IO (4 graphs still missing). Troubleshoot claude-mem Windows worker (plugin works without it; worker adds background observation ingest).

### 2026-04-22 (evening) — D:/Development — Unity graph built + query skill + audit skill + research pass
- **Unity knowledge graph built:** 283 nodes, 513 edges, 14 labeled communities (Unity Hive Brain & Corporate Vault / Client Portfolio / Ecosire Platform & Knowledge Base / Odoo Module Library / SEO-AEO-GEO / Agent Fleet / Cheatsheets & Production Infra / CLI Reference / People / + 5 templates). 10 god nodes, 5 surprising cross-community connections. Output: `graphify-out/graph.json` (332KB), `graph.html` (247KB), `GRAPH_REPORT.md` (12KB). Extracted via 5 parallel general-purpose subagents in ~3min.
- **New skills added at user level:** `hive-mind-query` (queries graphify graph before 3+ reads, 71.5× token reduction) and `hive-mind-audit` (10-point monthly health check — vault, backup, graph freshness, skill wiring, credentials hygiene, session log activity, SSH inventory, graphify features, ecosystem watch).
- **Research landscape captured:** top 5 similar projects (claude-mem, graphify, obsidian-skills, code-review-graph, cognee/supermemory); prevailing patterns (short CLAUDE.md + Skills, symbol+graph > embeddings, MCP as memory socket, hooks over prompts, AGENTS.md standard); 5 ranked improvements (graphify hook install / graphify.serve MCP / AGENTS.md shims / claude-mem compression / defuddle pipeline); 3 risks (prompt injection via vault, stale graph confidence, Dropbox+multi-agent write races).
- Canonical facts promoted: [[MOC - Hive Mind]] now references the built graph; user-level [[CLAUDE]] lists all 5 installed skills.
- Pending next session: run `/graphify .` inside each of D:/Development / D:/ECOSIRE.COM / D:/ECOSIRE.AI / D:/ECOSIRE.IO to build their first code graphs.

### 2026-04-22 — D:/Development — Unity hive-brain infrastructure complete (rename + graphify + hive-mind skills + daily GitHub backup + server/key inventory)
- Dropbox vault renamed: `Muhammad Amir Obsidian Vault` → **Unity**. Claude Code project dir + GitHub repo (`engrmuhammadamirnazir/Unity`) renamed to match. Local `origin` remote updated.
- Installed `kepano/obsidian-skills` into `<vault>/.claude/skills/` (obsidian-markdown, obsidian-bases, json-canvas, obsidian-cli, defuddle) — gitignored (upstream content).
- Installed `graphifyy` (v0.4.25) + `/graphify` skill at user level (`~/.claude/skills/graphify/`). Available in every Claude Code session.
- Wrote `.graphifyignore` for Unity, D:/Development, D:/ECOSIRE.COM, D:/ECOSIRE.AI, D:/ECOSIRE.IO (credentials + heavy binaries excluded).
- Created `hive-mind-sync` + `hive-mind-load` user-level skills at `~/.claude/skills/` (invokable from every session).
- Updated `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (applies to every session) + every sibling project CLAUDE.md (Development, ECOSIRE.COM, ECOSIRE.AI, ECOSIRE.IO, Company, Office, OpenClaw) with a MANDATORY Hive-Mind banner — dev agents previously forgot cross-project state.
- **Daily Unity backup:** Windows Scheduled Task `Ecosire-Unity-Daily-Backup` runs `C:\Users\Amir Nazir\scripts\hive-mind\backup_unity.bat` at 23:50 local (next run tonight). Script: `backup_unity.sh` (bash). Log dir: `C:\Users\Amir Nazir\scripts\hive-mind\logs\`.
- **Server & Key Inventory:** Created `[[Server & Key Inventory]]` under `03 - Areas/Credentials & Access/` consolidating every client server, IP, SSH user, and key file path. Copied 11 SSH keys (ecosire.pem, hetzner_demo, sahara.pem, remittance.pem, diamond_group, ecosire_main(+.pub), alvi_aws.pem, ustelekomecosire.pem, id_ed25519(+.pub)) into `03 - Areas/Credentials & Access/SSH Keys/`. Folder is gitignored — values live in Dropbox only.
- Canonical facts promoted: [[MOC - Hive Mind]], [[Server & Key Inventory]], [[CLAUDE]] (vault root).
- Pending (not blocking): run `/graphify .` in a fresh session for each of Unity, D:/Development, D:/ECOSIRE.COM, D:/ECOSIRE.AI, D:/ECOSIRE.IO to build their first knowledge graphs. After the first full build, weekly cron can run `graphify update <path>` (no LLM) for incremental refresh.
